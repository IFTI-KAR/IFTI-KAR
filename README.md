## ⏳ Full-Time Animation

```css
@keyframes fadeSlideIn {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

.section {
  animation: fadeSlideIn 1.2s ease-in-out forwards;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

```html
<div class="section">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
```

> 💡 Add the `section` class to any block or container element to give it a clean full-time fade-and-slide-in animation.
